Welcome to the Lumos documentation
==================================

**Lumos** is a Python library for calculating the optical brightness of artificial satellites.

More specifically, Lumos allows the user to:

- Fit analytic BRDFs (bidirectional reflectance distribution functions) to measured data.
- Create brightness models of satellites.
- Calculate satellite optical brightness for observers on the ground.

Possible applications include:

- Allowing optical brightness to be used as a design constraint by satellite operators.
- Lets astronomers plan observations based on when and where in the sky satellites are brightest.
